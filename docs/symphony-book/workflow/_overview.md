# Workflow

Symphony has a built-in workflow engine that captures complex operational workflows into declarative models. In addition to basic workflow engine features like branches, conditions, loops and stateful stages, Symphony also supports a set of unique workflow features to enable large-scale, automated operations, including:
* Remote execution of stages. 
* Scheduled execution.
* Isolated execution environment per workflow stage.
* Fan-out execution of stages (map-reduce).
